# 🔰 ABOUT 
- ✨ I wanted to share some amazing free resources for learning Python! 🤓👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
- ✨ If you're interested in learning Python or want to enhance your skills, these resources are perfect for you! 🚀
- 🤓 Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, these resources will help you enhance your skills and take your coding abilities to the next level. 💪

# 👨‍💻 Getting Started 
- To get started, you'll need to have `Python` installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- You'll also need to have `Jupyter` installed. You can install it using `pip` using below commands :
```
pip install jupyter
```
- Once you have `Python` and `Jupyter` installed, you can `clone` this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/creativepuru/Python-Basics.git
```
- Then, navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned and start Jupyter by using below commands :
```
cd <Python-Basics>
jupyter notebook
```
- This will open the `Jupyter notebook interface` in your default `web browser`. From here, you can navigate to the notebooks directory and open any of the notebooks to view the code examples.

# 🔰 Description
### The notebooks in this repository cover the following topics:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else statements, loops)
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Functions
- Classes and objects
- File input/output
- Exception Handling
### Each notebook contains code examples and explanations of the concepts being covered. I encourage you to experiment with the code and modify it to see what happens 🤓
